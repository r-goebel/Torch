# LED torch
On the EH18 I got the idea to put an LED strip on a cardboard tube to use the full 5m without having to unwind and wind it all the time. The connections for 5V will be installed permanently and can easily be plugged in later. For the effects an ESP is installed, which is also powered via the 5V connection. 

## Material
  * cardboard shipping roll (D=80mm; L=600mm(?))
  * 5m LED Strip (WS2812b; Amazon)
  * Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266)
  * 3 Capacitor (1000 ÂµF)
  * Resistor 470 Ohm
  * Resistor 10k Ohm 
  * Diode
  * Cable (For power and data)
  * Power supply 5V (up to now max. 2A --> Maximum brightness not higher than 20)
  * XT30 for connection between power supply and torch
  * MR30 for connection between Power suppli/PCB and the LEDstrip
  
  For an advanced look:
  * Laser-cutted wood box (housing for PCB and Torch-Mount)
  * Lamp Foil and Sandwich paper for light scattering

## Effects
This project additionally needs the Effect-library: https://github.com/r-goebel/Effects
